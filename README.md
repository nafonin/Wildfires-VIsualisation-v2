# US Wildfires Visualisation

The issue of wildfires becomes increasingly more distressful today, with fires killing people and animals, and
destroying natural environments animals live in. This mini project is dedicated to highlighting this issue by
visualising its impact.

The data I use is a Kaggle dataset "1.88 Million US Wildfires" published by Rachael Tatman and available for public use.
The dataset encompasses 24 years of geo-referenced wildfire records across the US.
